1. Project Title: Inclusive Public Transit Navigator

2. Name & Roll Number: Anishka Khurana - 2024-B-24082006A

3. Problem Statement: Public transportation systems often lack reliable, real-time information regarding accessibility for people with disabilities. Issues like broken elevators, blocked ramps, or the absence of audio cues can make navigating transit a frustrating and sometimes impossible task. This project aims to bridge the information gap, empowering individuals with disabilities to travel with greater confidence and independence.

4. Proposed Solution / Idea: An inclusive mobile application that provides real-time, crowd-sourced accessibility information for public transit. The app will offer accessible route planning, allowing users to filter for specific needs such as ramps or elevators. It will also provide an easy way for users to report and view accessibility issues, creating a dynamic and reliable network of information.

5. Key Features:
* **Accessible Route Planner**: A navigation feature that finds and suggests routes based on a user's specific accessibility requirements (e.g., wheelchair accessibility, elevator access).
* **Real-time Accessibility Reporting**: A simple interface for users to report issues like broken elevators, obstructed ramps, or non-functional audio cues.
* **Crowd-Sourced Updates**: Notifications and alerts that inform users of real-time accessibility problems reported by the community.
* **Audio-Assisted Navigation**: A voice-guided feature for users with visual impairments that provides turn-by-turn directions and descriptions of stations and surroundings.
* **Station and Vehicle Details**: Provides detailed information on specific transit stations and vehicles, including photos and a list of available accessibility features.
* **Emergency Contact Integration**: A quick-access button to contact local transit authorities or emergency services if a user encounters a problem.

6. Target Users / Audience: People with disabilities, senior citizens, parents with strollers, tourists, and anyone needing detailed accessibility information for public transit.

7. Technology Stack:
* **Mobile Framework**:React Native for cross-platform development.
* **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for database, Authentication for user management, Cloud Functions for backend logic).
* **Mapping & Geolocation**: Google Maps API or Mapbox API.
* **UI/UX**: Material Design or a custom design system with a focus on accessibility (e.g., high contrast, large text options).
* **Data Management**: For crowd-sourced data, a real-time database to ensure immediate updates.

8. Expected Outcome: A functional, user-friendly mobile application that provides accurate, real-time accessibility information for public transit routes. The app should reduce travel anxiety and improve the overall experience for a key demographic of public transit users. The final app will have a clean, accessible interface and a robust system for community-driven data.

9. Timeline:
* **Weeks 1-2**: Research, UI/UX design, and prototype creation.
* **Weeks 3-5**: Core feature development (accessible route planner, real-time reporting).
* **Weeks 6-7**: Backend integration, database setup, and push notification implementation.
* **Week 8**: Testing, bug fixing, and final polish.

10. Additional Notes: This project will require careful consideration of accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG guidelines) in its design. One of the main challenges will be ensuring data integrity and preventing false reports in the crowd-sourced system.
