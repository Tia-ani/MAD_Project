## Project Details

**Project Title:** Inclusive Public Transit Navigator  
**Author:** Anishka Khurana  
**Roll Number:** 2024-B-24082006A

## Problem Statement

Public transportation systems often lack reliable, real-time information regarding accessibility for people with disabilities. Issues such as **broken elevators, blocked ramps, or missing audio cues** make daily commutes difficult or even impossible for many users.

This project aims to bridge this **information gap**, enabling individuals with disabilities to travel more confidently and independently.

---

## Proposed Solution

**Inclusive Public Transit Navigator** is a mobile application designed to provide **real-time, crowd-sourced accessibility information** for public transit systems.  
Users can:
- View accessibility features of nearby stations.
- Report accessibility issues in real-time.
- Receive community updates on elevator/ramp conditions.
- Use audio-assisted navigation for visually impaired users.

The system fosters a **community-driven feedback loop**, ensuring information stays current and reliable.
